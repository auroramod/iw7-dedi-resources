# IW7 Dedicated Server Resources
This repoistory contains the IW7 Dedicated Server config files and scripts to easily start a server.

If you are looking to modify the server config to your liking:
1. Go to **iw7-mod** folder, and open the **server.cfg** *(if zombies, do server_zm.cfg)* in a text editor of your choice, like Notepad.
2. Scroll through the list of dvars, and change your values out. This includes hostname, password if you want, a rcon_password, the map rotation, and more!

If you are looking to modify the server starter .bat script:
1. Go to the .bat, right click, and click "Edit".
2. There, you can change your config name, port, or mod folder of choice.

Contributions are welcome!
